This is a group project with the aim to enhance skills in database management system. 
It takes the form of a Wine Auction Site, built with SQL, PHP, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 

Highlights of the key functionalities: 

- Users can register with the system and create accounts. Users have roles of seller or buyer with different privileges. 
- Sellers can create auctions for particular items, setting suitable conditions and features of the items including the item description, categorisation, starting price, reserve price and end date. 
- Buyers can search the system for particular kinds of item being auctioned and can browse and visually re-arrange listings of items within categories. 
- Buyers can bid for items and see the bids other users make as they are received. The system will manage the auction until the set end time and award the item to the highest bidder. The system should confirm to both the winner and seller of an auction its outcome.
- Buyers can watch auctions on items and receive emailed updates on bids on those items including notifications when they are outbid. 
- Buyers can receive recommendations for items to bid on based on collaborative filtering (i.e., â€˜you might want to bid on the sorts of things other people, who have also bid on the sorts of things you have previously bid on, are currently bidding on).
