# Database Creation

**Instructions:**
To create the database run the contents of database_creation.sql as a query in
phpMyAdmin and then do the exact same for dummy_data.sql.

In order to get the bid management and notifications working correctly please
follow the instructions in the README.md file within the stored_procedures
and triggers folders.

The legacy folder can be ignored, it shows how our database has progressed over time.
